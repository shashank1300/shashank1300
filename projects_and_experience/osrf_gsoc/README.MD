# Shashank Rao - Projects & Experience for OSRF GSoC 2025 üöÄ

Welcome! This section showcases some of my projects and relevant experience, compiled as part of my application for the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025** program with the **Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)**.

My proposed project is the **"Ray tracing enabled Faster-Than-Real-Time GPU based lidar plugin for Gazebo"** üí°. The projects listed below highlight skills and interests relevant to this proposal, including robotics simulation, sensor data processing, C++/Python programming, computer vision, and hardware/software integration.

This is intended as a dynamic overview ‚Äì I may add more projects or details over time.
