# Shashank Rao - Projects & Experience for FOSSI GSoC 2025 üöÄ

Welcome! This section showcases some of my projects and relevant experience, compiled as part of my application for the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025** program with the **FOSSI Foundation**.

My proposed project is the **"ZynqParrot RISC-V Tracer"**. The projects listed below highlight skills and interests relevant to this proposal, including embedded systems, hardware-software interaction, simulation, and general software development.

This is intended as a dynamic overview ‚Äì I may add more projects or details over time.

## Highlighted Projects üõ†Ô∏è

Here's a summary of key projects:

### Fully Automatic Washing Machine Controller
* **Description:** Designed and implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) based control system for a fully automatic washing machine using Verilog HDL. The system manages different wash cycles (soak, wash, rinse, spin) with varying timings based on selected modes, handles inputs like coin insertion, start/cancel buttons, and lid status (including pausing timers when the lid is open), and displays the current state on a 7-segment display. This was developed as part of the Digital System Design course (ECL-106) and targeted for a Terasic DE10-Lite FPGA board.
* **Technologies:** `Verilog HDL`, `Finite State Machines (FSM)`, `FPGA`, `Intel MAX 10`, `Terasic DE10-Lite`, `Digital System Design`, `Hardware Description Language (HDL)`, `Simulation`, `Seven-Segment Displays`

### YOLO Object Detection in ROS 2 with Gazebo Simulation
* **Description:** Integrated the YOLO object detection algorithm within the ROS 2 framework, utilizing Gazebo simulation for generating camera sensor data in a virtual environment. Demonstrated skills in robotics simulation, software integration, and working with sensor data.
* **Technologies:** `ROS 2`, `Gazebo`, `Python`, `YOLO`, `Computer Vision`, `Object Detection`, `Robotics Simulation`, `Linux`, `Camera Sensors (Simulated)`

### Python Flask Web Banking Application
* **Description:** Developed a web-based banking application using the Python Flask framework. Showcased core web development principles and backend logic implementation.
* **Technologies:** `Python`, `Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Web Development`, `Backend Development`, `Frontend Development`, `Jinja2` * [**LINK**](https://github.com/shashank1300/Banking-app)

### IoMT Smart Wristband for Remote Patient Monitoring
* **Description:** Designed and prototyped an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) smart wristband for remote patient monitoring. The system utilized an ESP32 microcontroller, ECG/SpO2 sensors, and wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi). It incorporated edge computing via Raspberry Pi, real-time health tracking, AWS cloud integration for data storage/analysis, and a mobile app dashboard. This project involved embedded programming, sensor integration, cloud connectivity, and system design.
* **Technologies:** `IoT`, `Wearable Technology`, `Embedded C/C++`, `Python`, `ESP32`, `Raspberry Pi`, `AWS IoT Core`, `MQTT`, `React Native`, `Mobile App Development`, `Sensors (ECG, SpO2)`, `BLE`, `Wi-Fi`, `Edge Computing`, `Cloud Computing`
* `still under development`

## Additional Projects & Skills ‚ú®

* **Emotion Recognition and Hand Gesture Controlled Spotify Assistant**
    * **Description:** Integrated emotion recognition based on facial landmarks with hand gesture control for interacting with the Spotify API. Used the Mediapipe library for facial landmark detection and the CVZone library for hand gesture recognition.
    * **Technologies:** `Python`, `OpenCV`, `Mediapipe`, `CVZone`, `Computer Vision`, `Gesture Recognition`, `Facial Landmark Detection`, `Spotify API`, `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)`

* **ESP32-Based Car Safety Device**
    * **Description:** Developed an ESP32 car safety system to detect gas leaks (MQ sensor) and crashes (using pressure & IMU sensors like MPU-6050). Automatically sends emergency SMS alerts with GPS location (NEO-6M) to contacts via a GSM module (SIM800L) upon crash detection.
    * **Technologies:** `ESP32`, `IoT`, `Embedded C/C++`, `Gas Sensor (MQ series)`, `GPS Module (NEO-6M)`, `IMU/Gyroscope (MPU-6050)`, `Pressure Sensor (BMP180/BMP280)`, `GSM Module (SIM800L)`, `SMS Communication`, `Hardware Interfacing`, `Sensor Fusion` (basic), `Alert Systems`

* **CMOS Ring Oscillator VCO Design in Microwind**
    * **Description:** Designed and simulated a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) based on a 3-stage CMOS ring oscillator topology using the Microwind layout and simulation tool. The design was implemented targeting a generic 130nm CMOS technology process available within the tool.
    * **Technologies:** `Microwind`, `CMOS Layout Design`, `VLSI Simulation`, `Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)`, `Ring Oscillator`, `130nm CMOS Technology`, `Analog Circuit Design`, `Transistor-Level Design`, `Circuit Simulation (SPICE-like)`
